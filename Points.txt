FottyWeaver is no longer necessary. You can simply use INotifyPropertyChanged.
You don't need to use Microsoft.Windows.Shell. You can simply set WindowStyle="None" and ResizeMode="CanResize".
To use custom fonts, you have to click on each font file and set the Build Action in the Properties Panel to Resource, and in the
fonts.xaml ResourceDictionary instead of pointing to the file as "pack://application;,,,/Fonts/#Latto Regular" you just need to put "/Fonts/#Latto Regular".
